This project needs a .env file in order to work with 2 variables;

### MUMBAI_RPC and PRIVATE_KEY

The RPC being an endpoint to comunicate to the blockchain, I used quicknode.

And the Private key you can get it from your wallet, (make sure that you don't have funds in mainnet with this wallet as a security meassure).
